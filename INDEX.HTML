        <p>According to the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey, Nigeria has 35 million children under the age of five. Out of which, 14 million are stunted, 3 million are wasted and 24 million are anaemic due to poor nutrition.
            The data also shows that 45 percent of deaths in children under the age of five is caused by malnutrition, and Nigeria loses 15 percent of her GDP annually to the burden.
            The expert disclosed that more than 70 percent of Nigerian children live in poverty and 23.3 percent live in extreme poverty.</p>
